Controller highly recommended

if you don't have any controller :

- wasd to move (same in menu)
- press enter in menu to validate your choice
- press escape in menu to go back to the previous menu
- left mouse button to shoot particles (hold)
- hold right mouse button to drain particles around you
- hold shift to run
- press r to leave a trace behind you for 5sec that baits the ennemies.
Press r a second time to stop leaving the trace.
